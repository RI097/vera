<h5>
            There are <mark>three parts of the problem</mark> that I have focussed on in this case study:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
           <li> The waiting time of the queues,</li>

          <h5>I designed <mark> Vera,a mobile app</mark> that enables our users to seamlessly go through <mark> the entry process of the art gallery</mark> and add a touch to their art viewing experience.It allows users to view details about the art piece they are seeing through audio tours.Other additional details include <mark> gallery maps </mark> and <mark> an explore section</mark> where other activities at the art gallery are mentioned.</h5>

              You could listen to the audio clip telling your about the art piece,the process and what the outcome wishes to convey. Once you are finished with that,<mark>lets switch to music while you contemplate,relate and try to see a perception of that art.</mark>

          <li>When does the problem occur?</li>
          It occurs when a person looks at the painting and is unable to find the artist or know more about his work
          When they enter the gallery and get confused on where to start 
          When they think that <mark>visiting the gallery could be something more than just viewing the work</mark>

          <h5>An extension of the sitemapping is story boarding.I had a pictorial representation of the user sitemaps with me.</h5>
          <ol>My storyboarding session consisted of two parts:

          <li>Big picture storyboarding</li>
          <li>Close up storyboarding</li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Taking Linda as my primary persona,I sketched out her steps and actions for a visit to the art gallery</h5>
          <h5>I started with a bigpicture storyboard which shows when and where she uses the app. </h5>

            I drew up atleast two to three layouts for the same page and finalised the one I found most suitable.</h5>

<br>
<h5>
<ol>An <mark>overview of the script</mark> is given below:

<li>Introduce the project goal, and put users at ease.</li>
<li>Describe the scenario, set up the context, and let users use the app while thinking aloud.</li>
<li>Ask follow up questions and gather feedback.</li>
<li>Let users fill out a questionnaire. Thank them for participating.</li>

<h3>Measuring Success</h3>

<h5><ol>The <mark>KPIs(Key Performance Indicators)</mark> were: 
<li><mark>Time on task</mark>-How much time does it take to book a slot to visit the gallery?</li>
<li><mark>Conversion rates</mark>-How many users are able to  book tickets and  access the audio tours?</li>
<li><mark>User error rates</mark>-How often do the users get stuck or make errors while using the app?</li>    
</ol>
